    <p>
      NaughtyCamSpot provides educational guidance, ops workflows, and promotional resources for adult performers and partners. If
      you purchase a package or engage in paid services, those services are documented in a separate written agreement outlining
      deliverables and compensation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Account Control</h2>
    <p>
      We do not request passwords, take over platform accounts, or act as your legal agent. You maintain ownership and control of
      your accounts at all times.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Clients must be 18+ with valid government identification and platform approval. We reserve the right to decline or discontinue
      support if brand alignment or compliance is compromised.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for complying with platform terms, community guidelines, and all applicable local laws and regulations.
      We provide guidance but do not control or verify your platform compliance.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Liability</h2>
    <p>
      While we provide strategic guidance, performers remain responsible for their content, platform compliance, and legal
      obligations. We do not guarantee earnings or outcomes and are not liable for lost revenue or disciplinary actions.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Payment & Affiliates</h2>
    <p>
      Affiliate commissions and any paid service fees are documented in written agreements. Late payments may result in paused
      services until balances are cleared.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      Any disputes will be addressed through good-faith mediation before arbitration in the state of Florida, USA.
    </p>
