      <p class="max-w-3xl text-base text-white/75">
        You do not need extreme security to be safer online. You need a few repeatable habits: clear boundaries, strong
        accounts, and calm decision making when someone tries to pressure you.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">1) Account security</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Use strong passwords and a password manager if you can.</li>
          <li>Enable 2FA on email and creator platforms.</li>
          <li>Never share passwords, even with “helpers”.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Small habit: log out of accounts on shared devices. If you use a phone for content, lock it with a PIN and keep auto-backups in mind.

        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Decide your face policy, location policy, and off-platform contact policy.</li>
          <li>Write a short “no list” so you do not negotiate under pressure.</li>
          <li>Keep your rules consistent. Consistency lowers drama.</li>

        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Do not show mail, street signs, or unique landmarks in content.</li>
          <li>Be careful with reflections, windows, and background audio.</li>
          <li>Separate creator email and creator phone (or use a dedicated number if you must).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you travel, do not post your location in real time. Post later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy is a habit. Small rules repeated every day add up.

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">4) Content boundaries that protect you</h2>
        <p>
          Privacy is not only “tech”. It is also what you show and what you never show. Decide your boundaries early and keep them stable.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Face policy: full face, partial, or none. Pick one and stick to it.</li>
          <li>Personal details: do not share legal name, address, workplace, or school.</li>
          <li>Off-platform contact: do not move to random apps with strangers.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">5) Scam red flags</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Anyone who asks for your password is not safe.</li>
          <li>Anyone who forces urgency (“right now or you lose it”) is usually a scam.</li>
          <li>Anyone who asks you to move money around is a hard no.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NaughtyCamSpot keeps trust posture explicit. If something feels off, use the Trust &amp; Safety page and ask before you act.

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">6) How to handle pressure (simple script)</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of unsafe situations start with pressure. If someone pushes you to break a boundary, use a short script and end the conversation.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>“No. I do not share passwords.”</li>
          <li>“No. I do not move to private contact.”</li>
          <li>“No. I do not do that.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Keep it short. You do not need to explain. Safety is a policy, not a debate.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want a simple first-week plan that respects your boundaries, Apply. If you want promotion help later, compare Packages.
