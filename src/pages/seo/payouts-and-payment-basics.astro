        Different platforms pay out in different ways. If you understand the basics, you avoid the most common delays and
        safety mistakes. This is general information, not financial or tax advice.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">1) Common payout methods</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Bank transfer: usually reliable, sometimes slower.</li>
          <li>Payment processors: can be fast, but may have extra verification steps.</li>
          <li>Digital wallets: convenient, but region support varies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your best option depends on your country, your platform, and what verification you can complete quickly.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">2) What slows payouts down</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Incorrect legal name or mismatch between account and payout profile.</li>
          <li>Missing verification documents, expired IDs, or unclear photos.</li>
          <li>Changing payout methods too often.</li>
          <li>Chargebacks and risk flags (even if you did nothing wrong).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you change one thing, keep a simple spreadsheet: platform, payout method, verification status, and payout day.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">3) Verification checklist (quick)</h2>
        <p>
          Most payout issues are not “random”. They are verification problems. Keep your verification simple and clean:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Use your legal name consistently across the platform and payout profile.</li>
          <li>Upload clear photos of documents (no glare, no blur, no cropping important edges).</li>
          <li>Do not share documents in DMs. Use only official platform verification flows.</li>
          <li>Save confirmation emails and keep notes of what you submitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a platform offers a “test payout” or “small first payout”, take it. It is an early check that your payout method is configured correctly.
        </p>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">4) Safety rules you should follow</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Never share account passwords. Use 2FA where possible.</li>
          <li>Use a dedicated email for creator accounts.</li>
          <li>Keep boundaries for off-platform contact and personal info.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our trust posture is simple: no passwords, no exclusivity, model-owned accounts. You can read it here:

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">5) Recordkeeping (simple, not scary)</h2>
        <p>
          You do not need complicated accounting to start. You need a basic habit: track payouts and expenses so you can see what is working.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Save payout confirmations (screenshots or emails).</li>
          <li>Track basic expenses: lights, props, software, fees.</li>
          <li>Keep notes on what you tested that week (promo, offer changes, schedule changes).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This helps you make better decisions and lowers stress when a platform changes a policy or timing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep it boring and consistent. The goal is clarity, not perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you know your numbers, you can pick better packages and better priorities.

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">6) Picking the right platform mix</h2>
        <p>
          Some platforms are better for subscriptions, some for stores, some for live traffic. If you want a recommendation,
          start with Platforms and then Apply with your platform interest.
