      <p class="max-w-3xl text-base text-white/75">
        The first week is about routine. You do not need perfect lighting, perfect scripts, or perfect confidence. You need
        a schedule you can keep and a few repeatable moves.

        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Confirm your stream connection, backup internet plan, and a quiet space.</li>
          <li>Set a simple camera angle and light source (one light is fine).</li>
          <li>Write your non-negotiables: face rules, location rules, off-platform contact rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you want a quick trust overview first, read Trust &amp; Safety. It is plain English.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">Before you go live: pick the right platform</h2>
        <p>
          Your first week is easier when your platform matches your schedule, your region, and your comfort level. If you are not sure,
          do not guess. Start with Platforms and then Apply so we can recommend a best-fit mix.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">Day 2: Schedule and a goal ladder</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Pick 3 show days and one show time window.</li>
          <li>Set a small room goal ladder: warm-up, mid-goal, finish goal.</li>
          <li>Write one short opening line you can reuse every stream.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Consistency is the growth lever. A smaller schedule you keep beats a big schedule you skip.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">Day 3: Offer basics</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Pick 1 main offer and 1 upsell (do not make 10 prices).</li>
          <li>Write clear rules. Short and calm. Avoid pressure language.</li>
          <li>Prepare 3 “prompt lines” to keep chat moving when it is quiet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can upgrade your offer ladder later. Start with something that you can deliver every week.

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">Day 3 add-on: scripts you can reuse</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>One opening line: friendly, short, repeatable.</li>
          <li>One “quiet room” prompt: ask a simple question.</li>
          <li>One closer line: remind what is next and your schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most beginners overtalk. Keep it calm. Clarity builds trust faster than “big energy”.

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">Day 4: Simple promotion (no spam)</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Pick 1 to 2 social channels you can post on consistently.</li>
          <li>Create one repeatable promo format: teaser, schedule post, recap.</li>
          <li>Use a link page and keep your links updated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you want a structured promotion plan, Packages can help. If you want platform signup help, use the tracked links
          under Platform signup help and Apply.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-white">Day 5 to 7: Review and tighten</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>After each stream, write 3 notes: what worked, what felt bad, what to test next.</li>
          <li>Adjust one lever per week: schedule, offers, scripts, or promo cadence.</li>
          <li>Do not chase every idea at once. Keep your system calm.</li>
