    <p>
      We collect contact details, performance preferences, and analytics related to campaign performance. No sensitive identifiers
      are stored without explicit consent.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data informs concierge coaching, audience segmentation, and affiliate reporting. We do not sell customer information. Access is
      limited to vetted team members and partners bound by confidentiality agreements.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Retention & Security</h2>
    <p>
      Records are retained only while an engagement is active. Encrypted storage, multi-factor authentication, and annual audits keep
      your data safe. You may request deletion at any time by emailing privacy@naughtycamspot.com.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We receive compensation for some referrals made via this site. Recommendations are curated and never compromise performer
      autonomy.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Updates</h2>
    <p>
      Policy revisions will be posted here with a fresh effective date. Continued use of our services indicates acceptance of any
      changes.
