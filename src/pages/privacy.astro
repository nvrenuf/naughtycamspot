    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect contact details, performance preferences, and analytics related to campaign performance. No sensitive identifiers
      are stored without explicit consent. Submitted claim screenshots are restricted to PNG/JPG formats and validated before storage.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data informs concierge coaching, audience segmentation, and affiliate reporting. We do not sell customer information. Access is
      limited to vetted team members and partners bound by confidentiality agreements.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Retention & Security</h2>
    <p>
      Lead records are retained for up to 90 days, and claim records/uploads are retained for up to 180 days unless a legal hold
      applies. Automated retention routines purge expired records. Uploads and operational logs are stored outside the public web root.
      You may request deletion at any time by emailing privacy@naughtycamspot.com.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We receive compensation for some referrals made via this site. Recommendations are curated and never compromise performer
      autonomy.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Updates</h2>
    <p>
      Policy revisions will be posted here with a fresh effective date. Continued use of our services indicates acceptance of any
      changes.
