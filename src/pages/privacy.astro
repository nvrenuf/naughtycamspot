    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Information we collect</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
      <li>Contact details and intake preferences you share with concierge.</li>
      <li>Operational notes about launch cadence, kit selections, and platform approvals.</li>
      <li>
        Lightweight analytics (page views, clicks on tracked links) to understand which resources unlock StartRight kits. We do
        not store sensitive personal identifiers without explicit consent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">How we use data</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
      <li>Plan concierge coaching, gear calibration, and retention rituals tailored to your goals.</li>
      <li>Verify affiliate eligibility and ship StartRight resources to the right account owner.</li>
      <li>Produce anonymised reporting that helps us keep offers, banners, and workflows current.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Cookies &amp; analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on first-party measurement and do not run third-party ad pixels on GitHub Pages previews. Production builds may
      record aggregated usage to refine concierge operations; you can clear or block cookies in your browser at any time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Sharing &amp; processors</h2>
    <p>
      Access is limited to vetted team members and service providers under confidentiality obligations. We do not sell customer
      information or share it for unrelated marketing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Retention &amp; security</h2>
    <p>
      Records stay only as long as your concierge engagement is active or as required by law. Encrypted storage, MFA, and
      periodic reviews keep operational notes and uploaded materials protected.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-petal/70">Your choices</h2>
    <p>
      You may request a copy of your data, ask for corrections, or request deletion (where permissible) by emailing
      <a class="text-rose-gold underline-offset-4 hover:underline" href="mailto:privacy@naughtycamspot.com">privacy@naughtycamspot.com</a>.
      Continued use of our services after updates indicates acceptance of the latest policy.
