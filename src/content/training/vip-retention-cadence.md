VIP loyalty does not happen accidentally. It’s the outcome of scripted touchpoints layered with concierge feedback loops. The cadence below keeps your high rollers feeling indulged without burning through staff hours.

## Phase 1 — Signal review (Days 1–7)
- Audit nightly spend and DM replies. Flag anyone who hit 70% of your monthly VIP threshold.
- Ship personalised thank-you videos within 24 hours. Attach one concierge insight they unlocked (floor plan, mod prompt, or show note).
- Update the VIP tracker with their preferred incentives, favourite show themes, and red lines.

## Phase 2 — Momentum scripting (Days 8–15)
- Run a 20-minute VIP-only warmup show. Soft-release an upsell menu and log reactions.
- Rotate concierge prompts through your mods so greetings stay fresh. Each mod tags responses in the retention sheet.
- Drop a “72-hour priority pass” DM. Reward fast responders with a five-minute cam-to-cam promise.

## Phase 3 — Spotlight conversion (Days 16–23)
- Invite the top three spenders to co-design a limited bundle. Document the bundle in the VIP CRM tile.
- Publish a concierge-written teaser to social stories highlighting the upcoming VIP spotlight show.
- During the show, deploy three scripted moments: a gratitude toast, a reveal anchored to their bundle, and an on-stream testimonial ask.

## Phase 4 — Renewal handshake (Days 24–30)
- Run post-show concierge calls to lock the next month’s intent. Capture verbal commitments in the tracker.
- Send a luxe mailer (handwritten card + scented insert). Include a QR that routes to the next VIP calendar.
- Publish a private audio note recapping wins and naming the first perk of the new month.

### Implementation checklist
1. Refresh the VIP CRM tile each Monday with new sentiment notes.
2. Pre-write gratitude scripts for each tier so on-air delivery feels natural.
3. Align mod staffing around VIP nights to ensure the white-glove pacing holds.
