The launch room is your control tower. Before you ever hit “start streaming,” the concierge pit choreographs the first 90 minutes so nothing feels improvised.

## Set the room
- Double-layer blackout curtains behind the key light to eliminate spill.
- Mount a silent fan aimed at your back to keep temperature steady under studio lights.
- Place the VIP incentive table within arm’s reach and keep a Polaroid camera loaded for surprise drops.

## Script the operators
- Concierge lead owns the show rundown, DM cadence, and sponsor shoutouts.
- Mod 1 runs the welcome gate, tagging high-spend handles and logging them in the VIP sheet.
- Mod 2 monitors merch triggers, Discord chatter, and highlights that feed the after-show recap.

## Pre-roll funnel
- Send a 3-hour “doors open soon” DM to every concierge-tagged VIP. Include the private playlist and arrival cue.
- Publish a teaser clip to socials with subtitles and a `00:45` runtime. Caption references the concierge line for VIP escalations.
- Queue the first upsell call-to-action as a pinned message with the concierge line as backup.

## Live show cadence
1. **00:00–00:10** — Concierge lead does the high-energy welcome while Mod 1 sweeps the chat.
2. **00:10–00:25** — Showcase the offer ladder; Mod 2 tags every call-in who hits the `silver` rung.
3. **00:25–00:40** — VIP spotlight moment with a scripted toast, then the concierge lead transitions to the hero activity.
4. **00:40–00:60** — Run the hero activity. Concierge lead drops audio cues while Mod 1 handles DM escalations.
5. **00:60–00:90** — Cooldown with gratitude circle, release next stream’s teaser, and book three concierge follow-ups.

### Reset protocol
- Archive the chat transcript, DM highlights, and merch receipts into the launch folder within 30 minutes.
- Update the concierge CRM tile with results: revenue by tier, VIP attendance, and next experiments.
- Draft a 90-second voice memo for VIPs recapping the wins and naming the next concierge incentive.
