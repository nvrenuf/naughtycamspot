## Collaboration principles

- Always use opt-in collaboration agreements.
- Never exchange account passwords.
- Keep boundaries and content constraints documented.

## Cross-promotion formats

1. Story swap with timed CTA windows.
2. Joint teaser campaign with separate conversion links.
3. Event week collab with post-event recap content.

## Community rollout

Use your Discord/forum channels to recruit collab partners, pre-approve scripts, and schedule event reminders.
