## Tier 1: Daily movers

These are low-effort, repeatable actions priced between $5–$15. Think quick shoutouts, name-in-lights overlays, or a single emote request. They train casual viewers to transact and create momentum early in a show.

## Tier 2: Signature moments

Anchor this tier around $25–$60 with items that take focus for two to three minutes: a short routine, a camera angle swap, or a custom affirmation in your voice. Keep three options max so the room can rally behind a clear goal.

## Tier 3: VIP anchors

Reserve this tier for $100+ and cap it to two slots per show. Offer a private five-minute debrief after the stream or a bespoke clip delivered within 72 hours. Scarcity keeps the value high and prevents burnout.

## Pricing hygiene

Price endings at clean numbers—$15, $45, $120—so tips are easy to remember. Test one variable at a time each week and log the conversion in your StartRight tracker. Avoid underpricing your energy-intensive moments; they should live in Tier 3.

## Menu presentation

Display the ladder in your overlay and pin it in chat every 30 minutes. Before you end a show, restate which Tier 2 and Tier 3 slots remain so last-minute VIPs have a clear path to buy.
