## Desk glow (Foundation kit)

Place the 12" ring light two feet above eye level and angle it 15° down. Bounce a warm lamp off the wall behind your monitor to soften shadows. Set your webcam white balance to 4000K and lock exposure at 1/60.

## Bedside loop (Foundation or Studio)

Mount a single softbox at 45° to your face and add the fairy light backdrop from the Foundation kit. Keep ISO capped at 800 to avoid grain. This combo keeps the room intimate while highlighting eye contact.

## Couch spotlight (Studio or Luxe)

Use two softboxes at 45° angles plus a hair light on the back of the couch. Drop your mirrorless lens to f/2.8 for depth, and set your key light to 25% with the fill at 15%. Save the scene as “Couch” inside your lighting app.

Record a short clip for each recipe and store it in your StartRight binder. Concierge will reference the footage during your calibration call.
