## Tier 1: Welcome notes

Send handwritten-style DMs to your first five tippers. Include your next show time and a light boundary reminder. Keep it short; the goal is to make them feel seen, not to upsell yet.

## Tier 2: Limited VIP slots

Offer three VIP seats with perks you can deliver: a custom playlist, priority goal input, and a moderated group thread. Use a 72-hour window and cap at three to keep it manageable while you are still calibrating your rituals.

## Tier 3: Concierge aftercare

For the top VIP, offer a short post-show recap with concierge on BCC. We log feedback, update your scripts, and note any boundary adjustments. This creates proof for the next round of VIPs without promising anything you cannot sustain.

Use the StartRight templates for each message and tag every response with the VIP’s handle so concierge can follow the thread. Consistency matters more than novelty in the first two weeks.
