## Step 1: Proof capture

Screenshot the welcome email and first dashboard view the moment your account unlocks. Save the file name with the platform, date, and your handle. Concierge uses this to unlock the StartRight kit without requesting extra evidence later.

## Step 2: Payout verification

Open the payouts tab, choose your rail, and run a $5 test withdrawal if the platform allows it. Confirm the reference ID lives in your vault. This keeps the first concierge payout push from stalling.

## Step 3: Platform pairing

List your show hours, language comfort, and boundary notes. We pair you to two programs: a primary for launch rituals and a backup for promotions. Keep both handy so the kit links match your vibe and region.

## Step 4: Intake email

Send the proof, payout screenshot, and your hours to concierge@naughtycamspot.com with subject “StartRight Intake”. We respond with your kit release window and invite times for the first review call.

Run this play before you join the wizard and you’ll skip the most common delays—missing proof, untested payouts, and unclear show slots.
