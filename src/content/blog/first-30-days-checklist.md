The first month should feel like a guided runway, not a scramble. We split your tasks into four weekly packets so you always know what matters right now.

*Where your energy goes each week of the first month.*

## Week 1 — Build the base

Lock down paperwork, platform bios, lighting, and the shared storage we use for scripts. Record a dry run with concierge notes before you ever go live.

## Week 2 — Soft launch reps

Host two short streams to stress-test your setup. Collect five mod call-ins to calibrate cadence and confirm your voice tags sound right.

## Week 3 — Signature debut

Run the hero show with your ladder, activate the VIP DM follow-up, and log screenshots for your claim folder. Rotate mods so everyone practices the concierge prompts.

## Week 4 — Momentum and review

Schedule one collaboration, roll out an upsell DM, and prep the month-one review doc. Collect testimonials from early fans to fuel your next marketing push.

*Circle what is complete, then tag the next sprint.*
