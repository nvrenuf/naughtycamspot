## Use the right link for the right environment

Pages builds strip server redirects. When you are previewing, stick to the /startright path. In production, use the guarded join URL from the Join Models page so SubIDs and campaign tags carry through.

## Avoid mixing affiliate hops

Never layer a second tracking hop on top of the guarded link. Doing so often trips fraud filters and blocks the payout path we use to verify your account. If you need a vanity link, ask concierge to mint one that preserves the SubID chain.

## Keep proof aligned with timestamps

When you submit proof, include the timestamp of the click and the approval email. This lets us reconcile the SubID in minutes instead of days. Store the screenshots in a shared folder so we can re-run audits without asking you again.

## Monitor the first payout

As soon as your first earnings clear, grab a payout receipt. We add it to the proof vault, map it to your SubID, and push the StartRight kit live. No receipt means we have to pause before shipping the next ritual updates.
