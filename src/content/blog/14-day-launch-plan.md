## Phase 1: Orientation (Days 1–3)

We stabilise your tools, persona, and compliance. Day one is account hygiene: password vault, payout profiles, and ID backups. Day two focuses on lighting rehearsals with the concierge team, while day three locks your base show script.

## Phase 2: Soft open (Days 4–6)

You host short rehearsal streams to warm the room. We rotate through the three show scripts included in the kit so your mods learn each cadence. Capture performance notes after every stream—this data powers later adjustments.

## Phase 3: Signature debut (Day 7)

Your official launch lands on day seven. You run the hero script, introduce your tip ladder, and activate the concierge tipping tracker. Mods greet VIPs by name and nudge viewers toward the next show time before you log off.

## Phase 4: Momentum stacking (Days 8–11)

We analyse your first week, then double down. You stream every other day, alternating between your primary and VIP scripts. Between shows you send custom DM touchpoints using the templates from the StartRight kit.

## Phase 5: Expansion (Days 12–14)

We close with a collaboration or themed night, plus a post-launch survey for your top tippers. By day 14 you have baseline conversion data, a refined tip menu, and a concierge debrief scheduled to plan your next milestone.

Secure the StartRight kit as soon as your signup is approved so we can plug you into the full calendar with templates, pricing ladders, and aftercare scripts.
