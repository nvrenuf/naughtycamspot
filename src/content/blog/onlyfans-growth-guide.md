## Launch checklist

1. Set three offer tiers: entry, mid-ticket, and premium custom.
2. Publish a weekly cadence and pin it to your profile.
3. Build a renewal script for days 5, 12, and 21.

## Retention loop

Use a predictable cycle: teaser post, value post, engagement prompt, and conversion CTA. Keep message response windows explicit so fans know when to expect replies.

## Trust posture

Keep account ownership with the creator. Never share passwords. Use team support only for strategy, copy, and planning.
