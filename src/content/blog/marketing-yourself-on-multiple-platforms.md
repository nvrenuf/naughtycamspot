## Weekly promotion framework

Use one content batch and split it into:

- teaser clips,
- feed captions,
- one conversion CTA.

Route each channel back to your primary destination and audit weekly.

## Where to focus first

If you are choosing where to start, review [platform comparisons](/compare/).  
If you already launched and need acceleration, use the [Promotion page](/promotion/).
