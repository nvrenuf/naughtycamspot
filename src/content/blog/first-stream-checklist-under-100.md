## Set the foundation

Start with the room before touching tech. Wipe down your backdrop, clear clutter, and add one focal prop that matches your persona. Place a full-length mirror behind the camera so you can adjust posture between segments. This costs nothing but instantly increases polish.

## Lighting on a budget

Buy two clip-on LED lamps (around $15 each) and a pack of warm diffusion gels. Position one lamp at a 45-degree angle for key light and bounce the second off a white wall as fill. A strand of fairy lights adds depth behind you. These notes are expanded inside the StartRight kit&apos;s lighting checklist.

## Audio that flatters

Use wired earbuds with an inline mic instead of your laptop microphone. Wrap the mic in a tiny piece of foam to soften sibilance. If you have $20 left, invest in a desktop gooseneck stand so you can position the mic consistently.

## Ambience and scent

Light a candle that matches your room story—vanilla for cozy, sandalwood for luxe. Keep a fan or AC unit off during the show to avoid noise. Prep a hydration ritual so your voice stays silky when you switch between show scripts.

## Final rehearsal

Do a 15-minute dry run using one of the StartRight kit scripts. Practice your intro line, your first tip goal call-out, and the closing gratitude routine. Capture a screenshot for your claim submission while you rehearse so it&apos;s ready for concierge review.

You can create magic on a tight budget when every detail is intentional. Use this checklist alongside the full 14-day launch plan we send after your claim clears.
