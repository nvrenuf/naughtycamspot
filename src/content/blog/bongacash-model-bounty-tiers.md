## How the bounty ladder works

BongaCash pays out flat-rate bounties for each verified referral, escalating as you prove consistency. Tier one covers your first 10 signups, tier two runs through 30, and tier three unlocks premium concierge perks. Each tier resets monthly, so pacing matters.

The concierge team watches these tiers closely because they influence when we release extra creative assets. If you push too hard early on, you risk churn from cold traffic who never become loyal fans. We prefer stacking warm leads gathered through your shows and social storytelling.

## Tier one: Proof of concept

Aim to convert your most supportive fans here. Share a candid story about why you chose BongaCash and spotlight the exclusive welcome bonus they receive. Keep your messaging intimate. We recommend no more than three call-outs per stream during this phase.

## Tier two: Scaled invitation

Once you have proof, widen the funnel. Host a themed stream where mods can answer program questions in chat. Highlight your progress with the concierge tracker and create a tip goal tied to an exclusive video drop when the tier locks.

## Tier three: VIP runway

At this stage, focus on quality control. Tier three referrals trigger higher bounty payouts, but the partners review them carefully. Use the StartRight kit&apos;s DM templates to follow up with prospects before sending them the link. You want genuinely motivated models joining through you.

## Protecting your audience

Never blast raw links without context. Instead, weave the offer into your 14-day runway content so fans see it as a curated opportunity. When you claim your StartRight kit, we share the compliance cheatsheet that keeps your copy inside Bonga&apos;s guidelines.

Finally, schedule weekly retros with concierge so we can tweak your copy and track conversion velocity. A steady cadence unlocks the bonuses faster than a messy burst.
