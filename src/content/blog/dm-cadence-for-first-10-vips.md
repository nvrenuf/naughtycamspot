## Week 1: Identify your candidates

Run two short streams focused on conversation instead of shows. Track who chats, tips, and responds to your polls. After each stream, send a warm thank-you DM with a single question about what they want to see next week. The goal is to spot the ten names that consistently reply.

## Week 2: Guided offers

Split your candidates into two groups: live-room regulars and DM-heavy fans. Send live regulars a custom clip teaser and invite them to your next themed stream with a "VIP row" seat. For DM fans, send a concierge-style note with a private menu of two upsells and ask which one feels best for them.

## Week 3: Close and onboard

Pick the five warmest leads from each group. Offer them a simple VIP bundle: reserved shoutouts, first access to new shows, and a monthly DM check-in. Share a single checkout link from your StartRight kit and remind them the bundle is capped to ten people so they feel the scarcity.

## Hygiene rules

Never send more than three DMs to the same fan in a 72-hour window. Keep every message personalised—reference their last interaction so the cadence feels bespoke. When someone declines, move them back into the general audience and thank them genuinely so you can re-approach later.

## Concierge checkpoints

Log DM responses in your StartRight tracker and tag which offer resonated. In your weekly concierge call, review the tag data to adjust your scripts. Over time you will learn which phrases and timing windows convert best, and we will update your templates accordingly.
