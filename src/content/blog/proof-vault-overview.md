## What goes in

We log three proof types: partner approvals, payout receipts, and compliance confirmations. Each entry includes the platform, timestamp, region, and any relevant SubID so we can trace the path from click to cleared payout.

## How we redact

We blur names, account IDs, and location hints. Device photos never show the outside of your building. If a platform requires unredacted proof, we store a sealed copy that only the concierge desk can access.

## Update cadence

Proof records refresh weekly during Phase 1. When payouts shift frequency or a program adjusts verification rules, we flag the change in the vault so you know what to expect before you launch.

## Sharing with partners

When a sponsor or platform asks for evidence, we send a timestamped PDF bundle. You receive the same bundle inside your StartRight binder so your records match ours. Nothing leaves the vault without creator approval.
