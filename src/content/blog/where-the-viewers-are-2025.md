Our concierge tracker pulls hourly breakouts from the partner networks, so we see when each geography comes alive. Slot your hero shows where the bars are darkest and keep lighter programming in the low bands.

*Visual guide: when each region is most active (bands only).*

## North America and EU

North America stays dominant from late afternoon through prime time Eastern. Once midnight hits, EU early birds take over and hold until late morning their time. Keep bilingual hosts on rotation across this hand-off.

## LatAm pacing

LatAm spikes hardest Thursday through Saturday evenings. Weekday afternoons are softer, making them perfect for rehearsal blocks, mod training, or soft goal experiments.

## APAC late surge

APAC platforms stay muted until their late-night slots. The best-performing rooms for us skew toward Friday and Sunday. When you need a reset week, plan an APAC-friendly window so your metrics stay moving without exhausting your primetime crew.
