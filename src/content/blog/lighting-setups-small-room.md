## Setup 1: Ring + bounce

Place your ring light just above eye level and angle it downward five degrees to avoid flat light. Bounce a desk lamp off a white wall to fill shadows. This combo keeps your eyes bright while preserving cheekbone contrast on camera.

## Setup 2: Softbox + accent

If you have one softbox, set it at a 45-degree angle and slightly above your face. Add a smart bulb behind you with a warm colour preset. The accent light separates you from the background and works well for moody evening shows.

## Setup 3: Practical only

When you cannot use stands, lean on practical lights. Two matching table lamps placed behind your camera create a soft wash. Tilt your laptop screen for an extra glow and drop your webcam exposure to prevent blown highlights.

## Colour balance tips

Lock your white balance to 4200–4500K and stick to it. Avoid mixing daylight from a window with warm bulbs; pick one and close the other source. A consistent balance keeps your skin tone trustworthy and reduces post-processing work.

## Concierge checklist

Take a quick still frame of each setup and send it to concierge for review. We will mark hotspots, recommend diffuser strength, and store the winning layout in your StartRight notes so you can rebuild it in minutes before a stream.
