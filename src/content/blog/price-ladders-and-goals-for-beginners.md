We onboard new models with the most repeatable structure we have: three prices, three experiences, and one story arc per stream. It eliminates decision fatigue and keeps your pacing clean.

*A ladder that reduces decision fatigue.*

## Why three tiers

A $5 quick action warms the room, a $10 unlock drives momentum, and a $25 anchor becomes your hero reward. Keep copy tight and verbalise each tier every 10 minutes so late arrivals hear the plan.

## Goals stay singular

Pick one goal per session: a themed finale, a costume change, or a DM drop. Everything else is supporting dialogue.

*One clear goal per session, then reset.*

End with a gratitude loop that points to your next show. Mention the ladder again, log who converted, and update the concierge tracker before you close the room.
