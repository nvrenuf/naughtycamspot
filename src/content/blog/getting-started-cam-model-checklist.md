Starting strong is about consistency, not perfection.

## Your first-week checklist

1. Pick a platform path with [Recruiting](/recruiting/).
2. Confirm your equipment baseline and backup internet plan.
3. Set your show cadence before publishing your profile.
4. Write your first tip-ladder script and opening lines.

## Trust non-negotiables

- No password sharing
- No exclusivity lock-ins
- Account ownership stays with the model

If you want campaign support after onboarding, compare [Promotion](/promotion/) packages.
