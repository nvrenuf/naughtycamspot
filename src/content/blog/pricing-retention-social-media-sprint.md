## Weekly sprint template

1. **Pricing**: test one offer adjustment (price point, bundle, or duration).
2. **Retention**: test one comeback script for previous buyers.
3. **Social media**: publish two teaser clips and one conversion post.

## Metrics to track

- Conversion rate per offer
- Repeat buyer count
- Return viewer rate after 7 days
- Social click-through to your primary platform

## Educational video outline

Use this as a webinar agenda:

- 10 min: pricing ladder review
- 15 min: retention copy teardown
- 10 min: cross-platform posting cadence
