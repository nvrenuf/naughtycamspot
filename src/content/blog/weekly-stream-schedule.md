## Monday: Reset and plan

No streaming today. Review last week’s performance with concierge, adjust your tip ladder, and queue new banners or overlays. Post a teaser clip to your socials to set expectations for the week.

## Tuesday: Soft open (60–90 minutes)

Host a shorter stream to test updated prompts and lighting. Keep your tip ladder simple and invite returning viewers to Wednesday’s feature show. Capture who reacts to the new menu for follow-up DMs.

## Wednesday: Feature show (2 hours)

This is your main revenue driver. Run your signature script, spotlight the Week’s VIP bundle, and track conversions live. End with a clear CTA for Friday’s interactive stream.

## Friday: Interactive night (90 minutes)

Use polls, trivia, or a mini-game to involve chat. Offer limited-time Tier 2 items to keep pace high. Log every participant so you can send gratitude DMs on Saturday.

## Saturday: DM day (30–45 minutes)

No live stream. Send personalised recaps and teasers for Sunday. Offer a small thank-you clip to anyone who tipped twice this week. This keeps the pipeline warm without draining your voice.

## Sunday: Brunch stream (75 minutes)

Light, conversational, and earlier in the day to catch new time zones. Promote next week’s schedule and remind viewers how to join your VIP bundle. This closes the loop before Monday’s reset.
