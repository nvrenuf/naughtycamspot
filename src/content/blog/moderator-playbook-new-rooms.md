## Pre-show brief

Share the night’s script, the active tip ladder, and the one boundary you want enforced hardest. Mods pin the tip menu and update the pinned message whenever a Tier 2 or Tier 3 item sells out.

## First 15 minutes

Mods welcome each returning viewer by name and remind newcomers about the vibe of the night. They should drop a light CTA every five minutes that points to your Tier 1 items so momentum builds without pressure.

## Mid-show pacing

When chat slows, mods run a poll with two options from your Tier 2 ladder and set a five-minute timer. They should also highlight any VIP bundle slots left to create urgency. If a viewer is disruptive, mods use a warning script first, then mute.

## Closing rituals

Ten minutes before you end, a mod posts the remaining VIP slots and the schedule for your next stream. They also capture usernames of anyone who tipped twice so you can send Saturday gratitude DMs.

## Aftercare and review

Mods log notable moments in your StartRight tracker: jokes that landed, offers that flopped, and any boundary violations. In the weekly concierge debrief, you’ll use these notes to adjust scripts and update the mod checklist.
