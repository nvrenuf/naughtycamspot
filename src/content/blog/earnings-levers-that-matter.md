Every recruitment push starts with the levers we can pull without asking the platform for mercy. We audit your baseline, surface two quick wins, and model the compounding effect before we ever add a new traffic source.

## The six inputs we grade

Hours, consistency, GEO, conversion, price, and show craft build the base of every concierge forecast. We score each one during intake so you see why we prioritise certain drills in week one.

*Six inputs that move outcomes. Improve any two to see a lift.*

## Sequencing improvements

We stabilise the easiest levers first—usually hours and consistency—because they give the other inputs room to breathe. Once the calendar is predictable, we layer on GEO-specific offers and conversion scripts tailored to your top regions.

## Keep the plan simple

Every sprint runs on a tiny checklist. It keeps the room tidy, tells mods what to push, and forces us to measure only what matters that week.

*Three habits that keep the sprint on track.*

Wrap each show with a quick debrief: what unlocked, what stalled, and which lever we test next stream. Track the wins on your concierge dashboard so the next coaching call opens with data, not guesswork.
