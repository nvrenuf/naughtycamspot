# Issue Implementation Order (Conversion Fixes)

Why this order: remove first-touch friction and trust blockers (P0), then improve intake and purchase clarity (P1), then invest in scale via multilingual + SEO landers (P2). Each step reduces drop-off before adding more traffic.

1. P0: Remove/Delay StartRight pre-check modal on first visit (mobile friction) — see issue #97
2. P0: Simplify primary navigation to 4 items (Apply, Platforms, Packages, Proof) — see issue #98
3. P0: Rename 'Recruiting' language sitewide to 'Platform signup help' (reduce agency/studio confusion) — see issue #99
4. P0: Create dedicated Trust & Safety page and link it in footer — see issue #100
5. P1: Apply 'Fast Lane' intake for mobile (Telegram + platform interest + consent first) — see issue #101
6. P1: Packages page—add direct checkout or clear next step CTA per tier — see issue #102
7. P1: Reduce 'VIP/guarded/concierge gate' language on /join-models and StartRight (plain English) — see issue #103
8. P2: Add basic language support for key conversion pages (EN + ES/PT/RU/UA) — see issue #104
9. P2: Add 6 high-intent SEO landing pages (platform setup/checklists + promotion basics) — see issue #105
