# Issue Implementation Order (Paid Library + Tokenized Access)

Execution Order Rationale:
We first build the sales surface (Library page), then secure delivery (token endpoint + asset protection). After delivery is secure, we add deterrence (watermarking) and recurring positioning (Promo Drops). Finally, we automate token creation.

1. P0-1 – Library page — see issue #106
2. P0-2 – Token download endpoint — see issue #107
3. P0-3 – Asset protection — see issue #108
4. P1-1 – Watermarking — see issue #109
5. P1-2 – Promo Drops page — see issue #110
6. P2-1 – Token utility script — see issue #111
