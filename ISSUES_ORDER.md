# Issue Implementation Order

This file is a machine-friendly execution queue for Codex. We keep a strict top-to-bottom order, list only open work in the Active section, and move finished items to Completed to avoid rework.

## Active (open)

#97 P0 – Remove/Delay StartRight pre-check modal on first visit (mobile friction)
#98 P0 – Simplify primary navigation to 4 items (Apply, Platforms, Packages, Proof)
#99 P0 – Rename 'Recruiting' language sitewide to 'Platform signup help'
#100 P0 – Create dedicated Trust & Safety page and link it in footer
#101 P1 – Apply 'Fast Lane' intake for mobile (Telegram + platform interest + consent first)
#102 P1 – Packages page—add direct checkout or clear next step CTA per tier
#103 P1 – Reduce 'VIP/guarded/concierge gate' language on /join-models and StartRight
#104 P2 – Add basic language support for key conversion pages (EN + ES/PT/RU/UA)
#105 P2 – Add 6 high-intent SEO landing pages (platform setup/checklists + promotion basics)
