# Issue Implementation Order

This file is the prioritized execution queue for UX/psychology updates.

## Now (highest ROI)
1. **Move StartRight capture behind path choice**  
   Rationale: Removes first-load gate friction and increases first-click momentum on mobile.
2. **Make Signup Help (Free) vs Promotion (Paid) unmistakable on first screen**  
   Rationale: Clarifies the core decision instantly, reducing confusion and wrong-path clicks.
3. **Simplify Apply into one-screen Fast Lane and move the rest optional**  
   Rationale: Cuts form friction at the highest-intent point while preserving consent and lead capture.

## Next (high impact, supports conversion clarity)
4. **Standardize site naming to Signup Help (Free) and Promotion (Paid)**  
   Rationale: Eliminates terminology conflict across pages, improving trust and comprehension.
5. **Reduce key-page terminology complexity to A2 English**  
   Rationale: Improves scan comprehension for limited-English users on conversion-critical pages.
6. **Icon-code platform statuses and add a simple legend**  
   Rationale: Speeds decision-making on Platforms with low-reading, icon-led status clarity.

## Later (supportive UX enhancements)
7. **Add tap-to-reveal micro-interactions to reduce reading load**  
   Rationale: Lowers cognitive load with progressive disclosure but is less urgent than core funnel clarity.
8. **Add Step 1 of 4 progress indicator on Apply**  
   Rationale: Improves confidence in multi-step flows; dependent on final Apply structure after Fast Lane definition.
